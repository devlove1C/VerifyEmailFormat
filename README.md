## Integration

### Integration through CocoaPods
CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Swift projects and makes integration easier.

1. If you don't have CocoaPods installed, you can do it by executing the following line in your terminal.

    ```sudo gem install cocoapods```
    
2. If you don't have a Podfile, create a plain text file named Podfile in the Xcode project directory with the following content, making sure to set the platform and version that matches your app.

    ```pod 'PSL-Engage-SDK'```
    
3. Install PSL-Engage-SDK SDK by executing the following in the Xcode project directory.

    ```pod install```
    
4. Now, open your project workspace and check if PSL-Engage-SDK SDK is properly added.
